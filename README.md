#  typescript-aop
An AOP ([Aspect-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming)) test with Typescript. In this example I used [Ts Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#decorator-factories), which is still an experimental feature, to add logging and caching functionalities to a simple factorial calculation class.
